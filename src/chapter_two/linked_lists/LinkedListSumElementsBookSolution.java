 *
 * 2.5 You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains
 * a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is  at
 * the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum
 * of the linked list.
 *
 * Example: Input: (7 -> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2). That is, 617 + 295.
 *          Output: 2 -> 1 -> 9. That is, 912.
